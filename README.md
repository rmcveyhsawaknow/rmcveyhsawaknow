Cloud Solutions Architect by trade, single father as a duty, tinkerer at heart. 

I will probably ask just enough questions to perk the interest of some and likely just annoy the rest. 

I started with CAD in 2001 using [Ashlar-Vellum Solids](https://ashlar.com/articles/old-cad-and-3d-modeling-software-on-new-operating-systems.html) while in a high school R&D class. Took a break until recently in 2020 when I started tinkering with a Creality Ender5 3d printer and lifting STL(s) off of [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/rjmcvey2013/designs). 

When I became bored with printing other people's ideas, like Tarmo4 a fully printed remote controlled car, I started working with OnShape and created a [1/10 scale RC top fuel dragster design](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d66598ac72435360dadb0da3/w/68c0f13137590ce039705110/e/69ab070c592bbcfbbe7db2ec?renderMode=0&uiState=622fe2b27f0f9e4b7eecb6fe), and then printed it :) .

I am happy with the the printed RC top fuel dragster, but unfortunately the mechanical loads on the plastic materials just does not hold up. At that point I started researching CNC with a goal to redesign the RC dragster, mill major structural components from 6061 aluminum for sturdiness and gears from steel. Then finish up the body and wings wings with 3d printed components. 

Roughly 30 days after receiving my v2-10, I have learned that CAD is "easy"... CAM is very tedious to say the least. :grimacing:

I have managed to mill wax, delrin and exotic hard woods. That was straight forward. Then came 6061 aluminum...
